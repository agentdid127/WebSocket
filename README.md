# WebSocket
This is a Java Plugin API to handle WebSocket Servers.

## Premise
I want to be able to quickly get WebSocket Servers up and running, with the ability to add and remove features quickly, and reliably.
With this, I can simply add a plugin, and I suddenly have a lot more functionality within a plugin.

## Compiling
To compile, clone this repo, and `cd` into the root directory of the repo.

Then run
`mvn clean install`

This should build the project.


## Dependencies
This project does have a couple of dependencies which are not on any maven library. You'll have to Clone and compile ConverterTools.

[You can get it here.](https://github.com/agentdid127/ConverterTools)
